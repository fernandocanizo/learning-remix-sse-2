# learning-remix-sse-2

Learning Remix Server Sent Events (SSE) - Round two. Cause the first attempt I used a couple of out-of-date tutorials and nothing worked as expected, so I never learned it properly nor finished that project.

I'm following David Adams' tutorial [Sending logs to the browser from actions and loaders](https://programmingarehard.com/2025/02/13/sending-logs-to-the-browser-from-actions-and-loaders.html/), he also has it on [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMPtjhvt9T0).
